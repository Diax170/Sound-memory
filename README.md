# Sound memory
This is a simple micro:bit project made with Microsoft MakeCode in JavaScript (TypeScript) editor. Wire the circuit, download the HEX file to your micro:bit and enjoy!

# How to play
- When you power the micro:bit, the 'power up' melody will play, the LEDs will flash and the 7 segment display will display 8.8.
- To disable the sounds hold the SW5 button (which is attached to P5) and press reset (in the back of the micro:bit).
- The LEDs will display a pattern and play the 'laser' sound. You have to repeat it by pressing the right buttons (if D1 flashes press SW1, if D5, D4, D1 press SW5, SW4, SW1 etc.).
- When you finish repeating the pattern, you will see your score increase. Press any of the buttons to continue playing.
- The higher you score, the faster becomes the game. Maximum speed is reached on score 40.
- If you mistake, the 7 segment display will show 'no', then your score. The LEDs will display the correct pattern. After that the game will restart automatically.

Feel free to edit, remix and share the code.

My best is 10. Comment your score!
